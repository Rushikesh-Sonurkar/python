# 📘 Day 3 – Modules and pip in Python | #100DaysOfPython

Welcome to Day 3 of my #100DaysOfPython journey!  

Today’s focus: understanding **modules** in Python and how to use **pip** to install external libraries.

## 🧩 What Are Modules?

Modules are reusable code libraries that help us avoid reinventing the wheel. Python supports two types:

### 🔹 Built-in Modules
- Already included with Python.
- No installation required.
- Just import and use!

### 🔹 External Modules
- Created by third-party developers.
- Installed using package managers like `pip` or `conda`.
- Can be versioned and updated over time.

## 📦 Installing Modules with pip

To install an external module like `pandas`, use:

```bash
pip install pandas

🐍 Using a Module in Python
Here’s a simple example using pandas to read a CSV file:

python
import pandas

df = pandas.read_csv('words.csv')
print(df)
This reads the contents of words.csv and prints the data.
